## Installation

Install Qtile and dependencies:

```
sudo pacman -S qtile pacman-contrib
yay -S nerd-fonts-ubuntu-mono
```

Clone this repository and copy my configs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikolaM-Dev/.doftfiles.git
cp -r dotfiles/.config/qtile ~/.config
```

Test it with **[Xephyr](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xephyr)**:

```bash
Xephyr -br -ac -noreset -screen 1280x720 :1 &
DISPLAY=:1 qtile
```

If the network widget doesn't work check **./settings/widgets.py** and look for
this line, you should find it inside a list called _primary_widgets_:

```python
# Change interface arg, use ip address to find which one you need
 widget.Net(**base(bg='color3'), interface='wlp2s0'),
```

If at this point the error still continues, you should check that the **psutil** python library is installed

```python
# you can install the library executing the command
pip install psutil
```

Once that's done, you can login. But keep in mind keybindings will not work
unless you have the same programs that I use and the same configs. You can
either change keybindings or install the software I use and my config files,
check out [this section](https://github.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles#keybindings)
for instructions.

## Structure

In **config.py**, which is the file where most people write all their config,
I only have an _autostart_ function and some other variables like
_cursor_warp_.

```python
@hook.subscribe.startup_once
def autostart():
    subprocess.call([path.join(qtile_path, 'autostart.sh')])
```

If you want to change _autostart_ programs, open **./autostart.sh**.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# systray battery icon
cbatticon -u 5 &
# systray volume
volumeicon &
```

If you want to modify keybindings, open **./settings/keys.py**. To modify
workspaces, use **./settings/groups.py**. Finally, if you want to add more
layouts, check **./settings/layouts.py**, the rest of files don't need any
configuration.

## Themes

To set a theme, check which ones are available in **./themes**, and write
the name of the theme you want in a file named **./config.json**, create it if
it doesn't exist. It will be created anyway if you don't do it before running
this config.

```json
{ "theme": "big-sur" }
```
